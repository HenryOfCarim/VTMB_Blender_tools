# VTMB_Blender_tools
Ancient blender tools for modding updated to the modern API
I was interested in Vampire: The Masquerade â€“ Bloodlines character modding and the first thing I noticed how old they are
I simply can't work with 2.4 Blender so this project intended to update them to modern 2.80+ API

As I understood because of the unknown strip algorithm adding new meshes is impossible
The current workflow is based on converting .mdl to directX .x files and then patching the existing .mdl with your edited file

For converting VTMB .mdl files you need Vamped 0.92 or  PackFile Explorer 3.09
